Children of the Corn: Revelation stars Claudette Mink as Jamie, a young woman who travels to Omaha to check on her estranged grandmother, who has stopped answering her phone calls. She arrives at her grandmother's rundown apartment building, where she meets the creepy landlord Jerry (Michael Ironside) and the friendly detective Armbrister (Troy Yorke). She soon discovers that her grandmother has disappeared, and that the building is haunted by strange noises, visions, and children.
 
As Jamie investigates the mystery, she learns that the children are followers of He Who Walks Behind the Rows, a demonic entity that demands human sacrifices. The children have been killing the tenants of the building one by one, and are preparing for a final ritual that will unleash their dark god. Jamie must find a way to stop them before they kill her and everyone else in the building.
 
Children of the Corn: Revelation is a low-budget horror film that tries to capitalize on the popularity of the original Children of the Corn (1984), which was a box office hit and spawned several sequels and remakes. However, unlike the original film, which had a rural setting and a creepy atmosphere, this film has an urban setting and a cheap look. The film also suffers from a weak script, poor acting, and clichÃ©d characters. The film does have some redeeming qualities, such as its gore effects, its twist ending, and its cameo appearance by Crystal Lowe as Tiffany, one of the cult children.

Children of the Corn: Revelation is a film that appeals to a niche audience of horror fans who enjoy watching low-quality and cheesy movies. The film has some elements that make it fun to watch, such as its campy dialogue, its over-the-top kills, and its unexpected twists. The film also has some references to the original Children of the Corn, such as the use of the song "Disciples of the Watch" by Testament, which was also used in the first film.
 
However, Children of the Corn: Revelation is not a film that will impress or scare most viewers. The film has many flaws that make it hard to take seriously, such as its lack of logic, its poor production values, and its bland characters. The film also has little to do with the source material by Stephen King, and does not add anything new or interesting to the Children of the Corn franchise. The film is widely considered to be one of the worst entries in the series, and has a low rating of 3.5 out of 10 on IMDb.
 
In conclusion, Children of the Corn: Revelation is a film that only die-hard fans of the series or lovers of bad movies might enjoy. The film is a disappointing and forgettable sequel that does not live up to the original Children of the Corn. The film is available for full download on various online platforms, but it is not worth your time or money. You are better off watching something else.
